### Troubleshooting

if you see following error message when you open index.html by using Chrome. 

> "Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: HTTP, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https." 

The cause is due to Chrome don't allow you to open other types of the file through a browser for preventing some security problem.

**P.S. I have not tried using other browsers, such a Safari. they may work. Cause I prefer using Chrome.**

There three ways to solve this issue.

1. Use a plugin of Chrome called " [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en-US) ", and I recommend this way.
2. Open Chrome app with " _--allow-file-access-from-files_ " flag, [more detail here.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10752055/cross-origin-requests-are-only-supported-for-http-error-when-loading-a-local)
3. Use FireFox instead.
